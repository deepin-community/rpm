.SH NAME
rpm\-plugin\-prioreset \- Plugin for the RPM Package Manager to fix
issues with priorities of deamons on SysV init
.SH Description
In general scriptlets run with the same priority as \f[B]rpm\f[R](8)
itself.
However on legacy SysV init systems, properties of the parent process
can be inherited by the actual daemons on restart.
As a result daemons may end up with unwanted nice or ionice values.
This plugin resets the scriptlet process priorities after forking, and
can be used to counter that effect.
Should not be used with \f[B]systemd\f[R](1) because it\[aq]s not needed
there, and the effect is counter\-productive.
.SH Configuration
There are currently no options for this plugin in particular.
See \f[B]rpm\-plugins\f[R](8) on how to control plugins in general.
